# StrongKey FIDO Server (SKFS), Community Edition Sample Applications

Sample code is provided with a brief explanation of what each sample does:

* Java Samples
  * [Demo](https://fido2.strongkey.com): A basic Java application demonstrating FIDO2 registration and authentication
  * [Basic](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/sampleapps/java/basic/): Basic Java sample application
  * [PoC](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/sampleapps/java/poc/): Proof of concept (PoC) Java application

## Sample Client
SKFS client offers examples of the various API calls using different available methods. Read the [skfsclient docs](https://docs.strongkey.com/index.php/skfs-home/skfs-administration/skfs-skfsclient-cli/skfs-v3-api-usage) for commands to test FIDO2 functionality against your sandbox.

The skfsclient uses a FIDO2 simulator instead of an actual Authenticator to demonstrate the web services on the command line. Feel free to download the [simulator source code](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/server/FIDO2Simulator) for your own use.
