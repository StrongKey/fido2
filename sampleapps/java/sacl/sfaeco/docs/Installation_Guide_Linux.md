# E-commerce Application 
This project is a service provider web application written in JavaScript and Java to work with the [FIDO(R) Certified StrongKey FIDO2 Server (SKFS), Community Edition](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2).

Web application developers worldwide face multiple challenges in the near future: learning about FIDO2, coding in FIDO2, demonstrating to decision makers what FIDO2 can do for their company, and acquiring budgets and resources to transition to FIDO2 strong authentication. Unless you spend many weeks (or months) understanding how FIDO2 works, addressing all these challenges remains daunting.

StrongKey has released this project to the open-source community to address these challenges. SKFS allows developers to do the following:

- Setup a FIDO2-enabled single-page web application that can run unmodified and demonstrate FIDO2 registration, authentication, and some simple FIDO2 key management on the client side
- Substitute the stock graphics and logo with your own company's graphics and logo without additional programming&mdash;just replace the graphic image files and reload the application; this allows you to demonstrate to peers and management what FIDO2 can do for the company, and how the user experience (UX) might look in its most basic form
- Learn how FIDO2 works; all the code is available here in a web application framework
- Use the FIDO(R) Certified open-source FIDO2 server with your web application without having to anticipate deployment issues&mdash;you will have already deployed this FIDO2 Server proof of concept

While this web application can show you how to use W3C's WebAuthn (a subset of the FIDO2 specification) JavaScript, it is also intended to demonstrate how to use FIDO2 protocols with SKFS to enable strong authentication.

## Prerequisites

- This service provider web application example must have a means of connecting with an SKFS instance
- Install SKFS either on the same machine as your service provider web application or a different one
- You must have a Java web application server; these instructions assume you are using Payara (GlassFish)
- The instructions assume the default ports for all the applications installed; Payara runs HTTPS on port 8181 by default, so make sure all firewall rules allow that port to be accessible

## Installation Instructions on a Server with a FIDO2 Server on a SEPARATE Server

1. If installing this sample application **on a separate server**, StrongKey's software stack must be installed to make it work. Follow these steps to do so:
    * **Complete Steps 1&ndash;5** of the [FIDO server installation instructions](../../../docs/Installation_Guide_Linux.md) but come back here after completing *Step 5*
    * **Edit** the *install-skfs.sh* script in a text editor; on the line where you see **INSTALL_FIDO=Y** change the value of **Y** to **N**
    * **Run** the script *install-skfs.sh*

        ```sh
         sudo ./install-skfs.sh
        ```
    
2.  **Continue** the installation as shown under _Installation Instructions on a Server with a FIDO2 Server on the SAME Server_. Note that this assumes SKFS was previously installed on the server **without** modifying the _install-skfs.sh_ script.
   
## Installation Instructions on a Server with a FIDO2 Server on the SAME Server

1. **Create** the following directories to configure the WebAuthn servlet home folder:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/strongkey/sfaeco/etc
    ```

2. **Create** a configuration file for the service provider web application.

    ```sh
    sudo vi /usr/local/strongkey/sfaeco/etc/sfaeco-configuration.properties
    ```
    
3. **Enter the appropriate values** (listed in **[]**) to configure the sample application with SKFS and an email server (you can also use GMail as the mail server with your own GMail account to send emails; just make sure you enable access through the Google account's security settings).
   **If the mail server has a self-signed certificate, make sure to import it in the GlassFish TrustStore before continuing.**

   ```
   sfaeco.cfg.property.fido.origin=https://**[hostname of FIDO Server]**
   sfaeco.cfg.property.fido.fqdn=https://**[hostname of FIDO Server]**:8181
   ```
   
   **Save and exit.**

4. **Download** the service provider web application distribution [sfaeco-v1.0-dist.tgz](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/sacl/sfaeco/sfaeco-v1.0-dist.tgz).

    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/sacl/sfaeco/sfaeco-v1.0-dist.tgz
    ```

5. **Extract** the downloaded file to the current directory:

    ```sh
    tar xvzf sfaeco-v1.0-dist.tgz
    ```

6. **Execute** the _install-sfaeco.sh_ script as follows:

    ```sh
    sudo ./install-sfaeco.sh
    ```

7. Test that the servlet is running by **executing the following cURL command** and confirming that you get the API _Web Application Definition Language (WADL)_ file back in response.

    ```sh
    curl -k https://localhost:8181/sfaeco-web/rest/application.wadl
    ```
    
## Removal

To uninstall the service provider sample web application, follow the uninstall instructions in the [FIDO2 Server, Community Edition Installation Guide](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/blob/master/docs/Installation_Guide_Linux.md#removal). Removing SKFS also removes the sample service provider web application and sample WebAuthn client.
If this SFABOA was installed on top of SKFS, the cleanup script will erase SKFS as well. If this was a standalone install, the cleanup script will only remove the SFABOA application.
