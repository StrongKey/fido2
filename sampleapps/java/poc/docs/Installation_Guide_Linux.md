# Proof of Concept (PoC) Java Application
This project is a service provider web application written in JavaScript and Java to work with StrongKey's [FIDO Certified FIDO2 Server, Community Edition](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2).

Web application developers worldwide face multiple challenges in the near future: learning about FIDO2, coding in FIDO2, demonstrating to decision makers what FIDO2 can do for their company, and acquiring budgets and resources to transition to FIDO2 strong authentication. Unless you spend many weeks (or months) understanding how FIDO2 works, addressing all these challenges remains daunting.

StrongKey has released this project to the open-source community to address these challenges. The FIDO2 Server allows developers to do the following:

- Setup a FIDO2-enabled single-page web application that can run unmodified and demonstrate FIDO2 registration, authentication, and some simple FIDO2 key management on the client side
- Substitute the stock graphics and logo with your own company's graphics and logo without additional programming&mdash;just replace the graphic image files and reload the application; this allows you to demonstrate to peers and management what FIDO2 can do for the company, and how the user experience (UX) might look in its most basic form
- Learn how FIDO2 works; all the code is available here in a web application framework
- Use the FIDO-certified, open-source FIDO2 server with your web application without having to anticipate deployment issues&mdash;you will have already deployed this FIDO2 Server proof of concept

While this web application can show you how to use W3C's WebAuthn (a subset of the FIDO2 specification) JavaScript, it is also intended to demonstrate how to use FIDO2 protocols with StrongKey's FIDO2 Server to enable strong authentication. Follow the instructions below to install this sample.

## Prerequisites

- This service provider web application example must have a means of connecting with a StrongKey FIDO2 Server. You can install a FIDO2 Server either on the same machine as your service provider web application or a different one.
- You must have a Java web application server. These instructions assume you are using Payara (GlassFish).
- The instructions assume the default ports for all the applications installed; Payara runs HTTPS on port 8181 by default, so make sure all firewall rules allow that port to be accessible.

## Installation Instructions on a server with a FIDO2 Server on a SEPARATE server

1. If installing this sample application **on a separate server**, StrongKey's software stack must be installed to make it work. Follow these steps to do so:
    * Complete Steps 1&ndash;5 of the [FIDO server installation instructions](../../../docs/Installation_Guide_Linux.md) but come back here after completing *Step 5*
    * Edit the *install-skfs.sh* script in a text editor; on the line where you see **"INSTALL_FIDO=Y"** change the value of **"Y"** to **"N"**
    * Run the script *install-skfs.sh*
    ```sh
     sudo ./install-skfs.sh
    ```
    
2.  Continue the installation as shown below in the _Installation Instructions on a server with a FIDO2 Server on the SAME server_ section. Note that this assumes that the FIDO2 Server was previously installed on the server **without** modifying the _install-skfs.sh_ script.
   
## Installation Instructions on a server with a FIDO2 Server on the SAME server

1. Create the following directories to configure the WebAuthn servlet home folder.

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/strongkey/poc/etc
    ```

2. Create a configuration file for the service provider web application.

    ```sh
    sudo vi /usr/local/strongkey/poc/etc/poc-configuration.properties
    ```
3. Fill in the appropriate values (listed in []) to configure the sample application with a StrongKey FIDO Server and an email server (you can also use GMail as the mail server with your own GMail account to send emails. Just make sure you enable access through the Google account's security settings).
   **If the mail server has a self-signed certificate, make sure to import it in the GlassFish TrustStore before continuing**

   ```
   poc.cfg.property.apiuri=https://**[hostname of FIDO Server]**:8181
   poc.cfg.property.mailhost.type=**[SendMail or SSL or StartTLS]**
   poc.cfg.property.mailhost=**[localhost or hostname of mailhost]**
   poc.cfg.property.mail.smtp.port=**[25 (SendMail) or mail server's port]**
   poc.cfg.property.smtp.from=**[local-part of email address]**
   poc.cfg.property.smtp.fromName=**[Human readable name associated with email]**
   poc.cfg.property.smtp.auth.user=**[Username used to login to mail server]**
   poc.cfg.property.smtp.auth.password=**[Password used to login to mail server]**
   poc.cfg.property.email.subject=Verify your email address
   poc.cfg.property.email.type=HTML
   ```
   Save and exit.

4. Download the service provider web application distribution [pocserver-v1.0-dist.tgz](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/poc/server/pocserver-v1.0-dist.tgz).

    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/poc/server/pocserver-v1.0-dist.tgz
    ```

5. Extract the downloaded file to the current directory:

    ```sh
    tar xvzf pocserver-v1.0-dist.tgz
    ```

6. Execute the _install-pocserver.sh_ script as follows:

    ```sh
    sudo ./install-pocserver.sh
    ```

7. Test that the servlet is running by executing the following cURL command and confirming that you get the API _Web Application Definition Language (WADL)_ file back in response.

    ```sh
    curl -k https://localhost:8181/poc/fido2/application.wadl
    ```
At this point, the PoC server is installed. Continue to install the front-end Angular application.

8. Switch to (or login as) the _strongkey_ user. The default password for the _strongkey_ user is _ShaZam123_.
    ```
    su - strongkey
    ```

9. Download the web application distribution for the FIDO2 Server [poc-ui-dist.tar.gz](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/poc/angular/poc-ui-dist.tar.gz).
    ```
    wget https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/sampleapps/java/poc/angular/poc-ui-dist.tar.gz
    ```

10. Extract the downloaded file.

    ```
    tar xvzf poc-ui-dist.tar.gz
    ```
11. Copy all the files to the Payara _docroot_.

    ```
    cp -r dist/* /usr/local/strongkey/payara41/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot
    ```
12. Optional: Modify the background image and the logo image.

    ```
    cp <your background> /usr/local/strongkey/payara41/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot/assets/app/media/img/bg/background.jpg
    cp <your logo> /usr/local/strongkey/payara41/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot/assets/app/media/img/logo/logo.png
    ```
13. The application is deployed in _docroot_ on the PoC server and can be accessed as follows in a browser:

    ```
    https://<FQDN-of-PoC-server>:8181/
    ```

## Removal

To uninstall the service provider sample web application, follow the uninstall instructions in the [FIDO2 Server, Community Edition Installation Guide](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/blob/master/docs/Installation_Guide_Linux.md#removal). Removing the StrongKey FIDO2 Server also removes the sample service provider web application and sample WebAuthn client.
If this PoC was installed on top of the FIDO2 Server, the cleanup script will erase the FIDO2 Server as well. If this was a standalone install, the cleanup script will only remove the PoC application.
