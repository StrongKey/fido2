## Sample Client
StrongKey FIDO2 Server client offers examples of the various API calls using different available methods. Read the [skfsclient docs](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/blob/update_documents/server/skfsclient/skfsclient.md) for commands to test FIDO2 functionality against your sandbox.

The skfsclient uses a FIDO2 simulator instead of an actual authenticator to demonstrate the web services on the command line. Feel free to download the [simulator source code](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/server/FIDO2Simulator) for your own use.
