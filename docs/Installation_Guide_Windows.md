    - Windows Server 2016
    - Windows Server 2019
    
----------------

-  A **fully qualified public domain name (FQDN)**; It is very important to have a hostname that is at least _top-level domain (TLD)_+1 (i.e., [acme.com](http://acme.com), [example.org](http://example.org), etc)&emdash;otherwise FIDO2 functionality may not work

-  **Install and configure OpenJDK with the steps below**:
    - Download AdoptOpenJDK from https://adoptopenjdk.net
    - Select the OpenJDK 8 (LTS) version and the HotSpot JVM options then download the latest release
    - Run the installer and ensure the following options are selected for installation:
        - *Set JAVA_HOME variable*
        - *JavaSoft (Oracle) registry*

- **StrongKey's FIDO2 Server must be installed** before the sample service provider web application and sample WebAuthn Java client

----------------

### Installation

**NOTE:** If the install fails for any reason, follow the instructions for [Removal](#removal), below, and restart from the beginning.

1.  **Download** the binary distribution file [fido2server-v0.9-dist.tgz](../fido2server-v0.9-dist.tgz).

    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/fido2server-v0.9-dist.tgz
    ```

4.  **Extract the downloaded file to the current directory**:

    ```sh
    tar xvzf fido2server-v0.9-dist.tgz
    ```
5. Be sure that you have your machine's **FQDN set as its hostname**. This is necessary to properly configure the self-signed certificate for the API. Check with the following command:

    ```sh
    hostname
    ```

    If you see only the machine name and not the public FQDN, run the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <YOUR SERVER'S PUBLIC FQDN>
    ```

    If you do not have DNS configured for this machine, please run the following command to add an entry to the _/etc/hosts_ file.
    **DO NOT run this if your machine does not have a configured FQDN and is still running as _localhost_.**

    ```sh
    echo `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'` $(hostname) | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

6.  **Execute** the _install-skfs.sh_ script as follows:

    ```sh
    sudo ./install-skfs.sh
    ```

    The installation script will create a _strongkey_ user account with the home directory of _/usr/local/strongkey_. All software required for the StrongKey FIDO2 Server will be deployed to the _/usr/local/strongkey_ directory and be run by the _strongkey_ user. The default password for the _strongkey_ user is _ShaZam123_.

7. Using the following command, **confirm your FIDO2 Server is running**. You should get the API _Web Application Definition Language (WADL)_ file back in response.

    ```sh
    curl -k https://localhost:8181/api/application.wadl
    ```

8. To test this installation of the FIDO2 Server, check out the [Basic Java Sample application](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/sampleapps/java/basic).

__NOTE__: Both the signing and secret keys in the keystore use default values and should be changed after installation is completed. The keystore and the Truststore are located under the _/usr/local/strongkey/skfs/keystores_ directory. Run the following command from _usr/local/strongkey/keymanager_ to see the usage and syntax for the keymanager tool, then change them both:
    
    ```java -jar keymanager.jar```


### Removal

To uninstall StrongKey FIDO2 Server, run the following command from the folder where the distribution was extracted:

    ```sh
    sudo ./cleanup.sh
    ```

This removes all StrongKey files plus the installed dependency packages. If you've installed the sample service provider web application and the StrongKey WebAuthn Java client, they will be removed as well.
