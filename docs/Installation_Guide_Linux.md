# StrongKey FIDO2 Server, Community Edition for Linux

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

-  **One of the following Linux distributions.** The installation script is untested on other flavors of Linux but may work with slight modifications.
    - RedHat/CentOS/Oracle 7
    - Ubuntu 18.04
    - Debian 9
    - Amazon Linux 2
 
-  **A VM with a minimum of 10GB space and 4GB memory assigned to it.** Some default VMs do not allocate sufficient space and memory, so please verify before getting started.

-  A **fully qualified public domain name (FQDN)**. It is very important to have a hostname that is at least _top-level domain (TLD)_+1 (i.e., [acme.com](http://acme.com), [example.org](http://example.org), etc); otherwise FIDO2 functionality may not work.

-  The installation script instlls Payara running HTTPS on port 8181, so make sure all firewall rules allow that port to be accessed.

- StrongKey's FIDO2 Server must be installed before the sample service provider web application and sample WebAuthn Java client.

### Installation

**NOTE:** If the install fails for any reason, follow the instructions for [Removal](#removal), below, and restart from the beginning.


1. Open a terminal and **change directory** to the target download folder.

2. Install **wget** if it has not been already.
    ```
    shell> sudo yum install wget
    ```
    or
    ```
    shell> sudo apt install wget
     ```

3.  **Download** the binary distribution file [fido2server-v4.3.0-dist.tgz](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/fido2server-v4.3.0-dist.tgz).

    ```
    shell> wget https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/raw/master/fido2server-v4.3.0-dist.tgz
    ```

4.  **Extract the downloaded file to the current directory**:

    ```
    shell> tar xvzf fido2server-v4.3.0-dist.tgz
    ```
5. Be sure the machine's **FQDN is set as its hostname**. This is necessary to properly configure the self-signed certificate for the API. Verify using the following command:

    ```
    shell> hostname
    ```

    If only the machine name is returned, and not the public FQDN, run the following command:

    ```
    shell> sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <SERVER PUBLIC FQDN>
    ```

    If no DNS is configured for this machine, please run the following command to add an entry to the _/etc/hosts_ file.
    **DO NOT run this if the machine does not have a configured FQDN and is still running as _localhost_.**

    ```
    shell> echo `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'` $(hostname) | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

6.  **Execute** the _install-skfs.sh_ script as follows:

    **NOTE:** If you are installing on Ubuntu VM, please make sure you are using *bash* as your default. If the default is set to *sh*, please execute **`sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash`** to change the detault to *bash* before continuing.
    ```
    shell> sudo ./install-skfs.sh
    ```

    The installation script will create a _strongkey_ user account with the home directory of _/usr/local/strongkey_. All software required for the StrongKey FIDO2 Server will be deployed to the _/usr/local/strongkey_ directory and be run by the _strongkey_ user. The default password for the _strongkey_ user is _ShaZam123_.

7. Using the following command, **confirm the FIDO2 Server is running**. The API _Web Application Definition Language (WADL)_ file comes back in response.

    ```
    shell> curl -k https://localhost:8181/skfs/rest/application.wadl
    ```

8. To test this installation of the FIDO2 Server, check out the [Basic Java Sample application](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/sampleapps/java/basic) or a [JAVA proof of concept (PoC) application](https://github.com/StrongKey/fido2/tree/master/sampleapps/java/poc) which also involves user registration using emails. 

**NOTE**: Both the signing and secret keys in the keystore use default values and should be changed after installation is completed. The keystore and the TrustStore are located in _/usr/local/strongkey/skfs/keystores_. Run the following command from _usr/local/strongkey/keymanager_ to see the usage and syntax for the keymanager tool, then change them both (The default password for the files is _Abcd1234!_):
    
    shell> java -jar keymanager.jar

### Removal

To uninstall StrongKey FIDO2 Server, run the following command from the folder where the distribution was extracted:

    
    shell> sudo ./cleanup.sh

This removes all StrongKey files plus the installed dependency packages. If the sample service provider web application and the StrongKey WebAuthn Java client are installed, they will be removed as well.
